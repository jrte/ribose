#The General Idea
Ribose (formerly jrte) is about inversion of control for high-volume text analysis and information extraction and transformation. It is a ship-in-a-bottle showpiece thrown together to demonstrate what computing might be if finite-state transduction, augmented with a transducer stack and coupled with a classical CPU/RAM computer, was a common modality for processing sequential information (i.e. almost everything except arithmetic). The general idea is to show how to make information work for you rather than you having to work to instruct a computer about how to work with information. Or, at least, how to reduce costs associated with information workflows. The general idea is outlined below and explored, a bit snarkily, in the _[Discussions](https://github.com/jrte/ribose/discussions)_.

An input source presents as a generator of sequences of ordinal numbers (eg, UNICODE ordinal, quantized analog signal, composite multivariate metric sample). If those sequences have a coherent pattern that can be described in terms of catenation, union and repetition then that description determines a unique regular set. This input pattern can then be extended to interleave at each input ordinal a sequence of output ordinals, which ribose associates with effector methods expressed by a target class bound to the transduction. This input/output pattern description is compiled by [ginr](https://github.com/ntozubod/ginr) to build a state-minimized finite state transducer or FST (ginr is a regular expression compiler that implements a wide range of operations on regular sets).

This is _pattern-oriented programming_ and it offers a novel perspective on how to deal with serially encoded information. Computing has undergone a torturous evolutionary path since its origins in the Manhatten project and has culminated in the realization that most algorithmic programming languages and the code artifacts that they compile to are inherently rife with security concerns. To address this major software and hardware vendors are pushing for more fine-grained application and service encapsulation and the use of wire protocols such as REST to express APIs and exchange information between services running in encapsulated process spaces. 

In that context, a pattern-oriented approach makes sense since it separates syntactic and semantic concerns. The latter are more easily addressed since the low-level syntactic concerns relating to recognizing features of interest are encoded in the pattern and removed from the expression of semantic concerns in effector implementations. For example, given the WSDL description of the response to a web service API, developers can express a syntactic pattern that recognizes only the features of interest and maps these onto a pattern of effector invocations that transduce the received response specifically and directly into the receiving process space. This obviates a great stack of software libraries that would otherwise be engaged to parse that process response generically.

In this way the notion of an *algorithm*, whereby a branching and looping series of *instructions select data* in RAM and mutate application state, is replaced by a *pattern* that extends a description of an input source so that the *data select instructions (effectors)* that merge the input data into application state. Here *target*, *effector* and *transduction* are analogues of *machine*, *instruction*, *program*. Most complex patterns can be decomposed into subpatterns, yielding collections of small cooperating transducers that are stitched together on ribose transduction stack in response to cues in the overall pattern.  Traditional *APIs*  describing method or web service interfaces are replaced by syntactic *patterns* describing specific media ccontainers. These patterns are extended by developers to produce collections of transducers that map conformant data streams onto target effectors and reduce and assimilate incoming data into the target domain. 

The range of acceptable inputs includes most context-free patterns, such as XML and JSON. To support this, each transduction process has a transduction stack, enabling transducers to call other (and themselves, recursively). The range of input ordinals can be extended with a set of signal ordinals, and an input stack enables target effectors to push out-of-band information for immediate transduction, thereby interleaving a synchronous control channel with the input stream. Also, and perhaps most importantly, target and effectors (lightweight Java classes) have access to RAM. These features enable transducers in the ribose runtime to effect transforms that are out of range of simple FSTs, as the Fibonacci example above demonstrates (the Fibonacci sequence is strictly context-sensitive).

Ginr compiles input expressions to state-minimized FSTs. The ribose compiler performs another transition-minimizing transformation on compiled automata to coalesce equivalent input symbols so that transducers have maximally compact representations for runtime use. For example, if 10 digit symbols are used equivalently in all states in an FST they can be reduced to a single symbol in the transduction transition matrix. The ribose runtime loads transducers on demand and provides a simple interface for running and controlling transduction processes.

Compared to Java regex, ginr provides a more robust regular expression compiler and the ribose runtime executes regex-equivalent text transductions with much greater throughput than the Java regex runtime. Below are the results of a benchmarking runoff between Java regex and 3 different ribose transductions (see ginr [source](https://github.com/jrte/ribose/blob/master/test-patterns/LinuxKernelLog.inr) for patterns compiled for these, also see *Time is Money. RAM is Cheap* in the Javadoc overview for other benchmarking details):

## Using Ribose
Ribose is a mature WIP and interested parties are encouraged to use the discussions section here to contact [me](https://github.com/jrte) for support. The general idea is to enable Java developers to embed the ribose runtime and develop transductions for domain-specific targets. The included test transductions use the base target, which provides simple select, cut, copy, paste, clear, in, out and other basic operational effectors that are themselves sufficient for most generic text mining use cases. Java developers can roll their own domain-specific targets with new effectors by extending `BaseTarget` or any subclass and implementing `ITarget.bind()` to return an array enumerating the new effectors. The new effectors as well as the any effector inherited from superclasses can then be used in domain-specific patterns, compiled to transducers and archived to the target model (note: the relationship between target and model is  one-to-one).

The base target effectors are:

| Effector[`Parameter` ... ] | Description |
| --------------------------- |:----------- |
| 0 | Null effector halts and throws DomainException |
| 0 | Nil effector does nothing (no-op) |
| paste | Extend the current selection by appending the current input character |
| paste[`text`] | Extend the current selection by appending text |
| select | Select the anonymous value as current selection |
| select[`~name`] | Select a named value as current selection |
| copy | Extend the current selection by appending the anonymous named value |
| copy[`~name`] | Extend the current selection by appending and clearing a named value |
| cut | Extend the current selection by appending and clearing the anonymous named value |
| cut[`~name`] | Extend the current selection by appending a named value and clear the named value |
| clear | Clear the current selection |
| clear[`~name`] | Clear the named value |
| count[`digit+` `!signal`] | Set up a counter signal and initial counter value |
| count | Decrement the counter and push `!signal` onto the input stack when result is 0 |
| in | Push current selection onto the input stack |
| in[...] | Push onto the input stack a signal or a sequence of mixed text and named values |
| out | Write value of current selection to System.out |
| out[...] | Write a sequence of mixed text and named values to System.out |
| mark | Mark a position in the current input |
| reset | Resets the input to the last mark |
| start[`@transducer`] | Push a named transducer onto the transducer stack |
| pause | Pause the transduction loop and return from run() method |
| stop | Stop the current transducer and pop the transducer stack |

Each `ITarget` implementation must provide a nullary constructor that will instantiate a model target to be used by the model compiler to enumerate and instantiate model effectors. The model compiler instantiates and binds the model target and effector instances to a model `ITransduction` instance. The model effectors are used in compilation and runtime context only to compile parameters per effector to complete the model -- in the runtime the pre-compiled model parameters are available for fast runtime binding of actual transductions. Model effector instances must be capable of compiling parameters only and are never otherwise invoked in compilation context. In the runtime each invocation of a parameterized effectoc receives an ordinal number that selects a precompiled parameter to apply. 

Ribose text transductions run on raw UTF-8 encoded byte streams, obviating the cost of decoding and widening from 8-bit to 16-bit inputs. Effector parameters in ribose patterns are always presented to ginr as a series of tokens with backquotes, which may include plain 7-bit ASCII or multi-byte UTF-8 encoded characters or binary `\xHH` bytes. These are compiled to an array of byte arrays for each parameterized effector call in ginr source. When the target is bound to a transduction the runtime will call the the effector's `newParameters(int)` method to indicate the number of enumerated parameters. The effector is expected to instantiate an array of specified capacity to receive compiled parameter objects. The model will then call each effector's `setParameter(int, byte[][])` method once for each enumerated parameter, passing the enumerator and an array of byte arrays to be compiled to a parameter object, eg `([byte[]] -> String -> DateFormatter)` for `date[mm\dd\yyyy]` or `([byte[] byte[]] -> [int int])` for `count[~length !nil]`. The `BaseParameterizedEffector.decodeParameter(byte[])` method is available to decode UTF-8 bytes in parameter lists to `char[]` array, which can be wrapped as `String` if required for parameter object construction. 

The model produced by the ribose model compiler includes collections of compiled transducers, signals, and value names. Transducers and signals are immutable in the ribose runtime. Mutable named values are localized per `Transduction` instance and are globally available to all transducers on the transduction stack.  The names selected for these artifacts must be prefixed by a special symbol, eg `@Transducer`, `~NamedValue`, `!Signal`, which acts as a poor man's namespace. The intention is to ensure that these names do not clash with effector names or input tokens, so that each tape (`(input-tape, effector-tape[parameter-tape])`) has symbols that are disjoint with respect to other tapes. This allows compiled transducers to be edited in ginr, for example, to harden them against domain errors (input with no defined transition is current state). See the `Tintervals` transducer in the test suite to see how this is done. 

The collection of compiled parameters associated with each effector instance is enumerated and the enumerator ordinals are used in the runtime to select parameters for effector invocation. When binding is complete each parameterized effector has an array of parameter objects indexed by parameter enumerators. At runtime, a parameter enumerator is passed to the effector's `invoke(int)` method to select the parameter object to be used in the call.
## Building and Running Ribose Transducers
To get started, build ginr and ribose and see the examples below for building a model and running transducers from testing artifacts included in the repo. You may then want to prepare transducers for other test artifacts you may have available. You will need ginr v2.1.0c or greater to build transducers to use in the ribose runtime. Ginr can be cloned or downloaded from https://github.com/ntozubod/ginr. I have included a copy of the ginr executable compiled for Linux in the ribose repo to enable Github CI builds to run transduction test cases. Also included is a whitepaper providing a detailed presentation of ginr with some examples illustrating usage of the available operators. These artifacts can be found [here](https://github.com/jrte/ribose/tree/master/etc/ginr). More current information can be found at the [ginr repo](https://github.com/ntozubod/ginr).

To build ginr,

```
	mkdir -p ~/bin
	pushd src
	make -f Makefile install
	popd
```

This will install the ginr executable in ~/bin. It can be run interactively (w/o line-edit) or from a catention of files into stdin. Single- or multi-tape expressions are compiled on receipt of a semicolon(;). Compiled expressions can be assigned to variables and referenced in other expressions for inline inclusion. 

```

ginr must be on your search PATH before building ribose. To build ribose and related test artifacts,

```
	ant -f build.xml all-clean
```

Transducers are defined in ginr source files (`*.inr`), and compiled FSTs to are saved to DFA (`*.dfa`) files in an intermediate build directory  (`:save ...` in ginr source). It is helpful to define a base set of common artifacts in a prologue. To compile the complete suite of transducers pipe the catenation of prologue with `*.inr` source files into ginr. Then run the ribose compiler as shown below to assemble FSTs into a model for runtime use with its associated target.

```
	automata=build/patterns/automata
	model=build/patterns/BsaeTarget.model
	target=com.characterforming.jrte.base.BaseTarget
	cat test-patterns/!prologue test-patterns/*.inr | ginr
	java -cp build/java/ribose-<version>.jar com.characterforming.ribose.Ribose --target $target $automata $model
```

Any class that implements `ITarget` can serve as target class. Typically, the target implementation marshals snippets of data (`INamedValue` wrappers for byte arrays) extracted from transduction input by its effectors into domain-specific objects for application or service use. Composite targets, composed of a main target that presents to the ribose compiler and runtime a collection of effectors from some number of component `ITarget` instances, are also possible. In any case, the target class determines what information to present to its effectors when they are instantiated. Effector implementations should be _stateless_, holding only references to statically-bound objects (normally only a reference to the target that expresses them). Parameterized effectors will also have their parameter arrays, which are protected in their BaseParamaterizedEffector superclass. 

To use a `transducer` compiled into a `model` to transduce an `input` file, for example:

```
	transducer=LinuxKernel
	input=test-patterns/inputs/kern.log
	model=build/patterns/BaseTarget.model
	java -cp build/java/ribose-<version>.jar com.characterforming.ribose.RiboseRuntime --nil $transducer $input $model
```

The entire file contents will be loaded into RAM and presented to the transduction as a single `char[]` array (see issue #6 to see why this is necessary, for now). The `--nil` option presents an initial `!nil` signal to the transduction, before presenting input file contents. This can be used for one-time initialization as may be required in some cases, eg when the start state would otherwise belong in a loop.

To use the ribose runtime to set up and run transductions in a Java application, include ribose-<version>.jar in classpath. No upporting external jars are required. See related Javadoc and `etc/sh/*.sh` for more details and examples relating to compilation and runtime use of ribose models for tranduction..
