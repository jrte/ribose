Jrte is about inversion of control for high-volume text analysis and information extraction and transformation. It is a ship-in-a-bottle showpiece thrown together to demonstrate what computing might be if finite-state transduction, augmented with a transducer stack and coupled with a classical CPU/RAM computer, was a common modality for processing sequential information (i.e. almost everything except arithmetic). The general idea is to show how to make information work for you rather than you having to work to instruct a computer about how to work with information. Or, at least, how to reduce costs associated with information workflows. The general idea is outlined below and explored, a bit snarkily, in the _[Discussions](https://github.com/jrte/ribose/discussions)_.

An input source presents as a generator of sequences of ordinal numbers (eg, UNICODE ordinal, quantized analog signal, composite multivariate metric sample). If those sequences have a coherent pattern that can be described in terms of catenation, union and repetition then that description determines a unique regular set. This input pattern can then be extended to interleave at each input ordinal a sequence of output ordinals, which Jrte associates with effector methods expressed by a target class bound to the transduction. This input/output pattern description is compiled by [ginr](https://github.com/ntozubod/ginr) to build a state-minimized finite state transducer or FST (ginr is a regular expression compiler that implements a wide range of operations on regular sets).
```
Fibonacci = (
   # fib(0): ~r, ~q, ~p ‚àà 0* preset to empty string ùõÜ, congruent with ùüé in ùù¢
   (
      # fib(1): ~q <- 0
      ('0', select[`~q`] paste)
      # fib(n>1): cycle (~r) <- (~q) <- (~p) <- (~p)(~r), (~r) <- ùõÜ
      ('0', select[`~r`] cut[`~p`] select[`~p`] copy[`~q`] select[`~q`] cut[`~r`])*
   )?
   # (~q) is selected and holds fib(n) 0s, so append nl and print result
   (nl, paste out stop)
);

(Fibonacci$(0,1 2)):prsseq;

(START)  0  [ select ~q paste ]                                     1
(START)  nl [ paste out stop ]                                      (FINAL)
1        0  [ select ~r cut ~p select ~p copy ~q select ~q cut ~r ] 1
1        nl [ paste out stop ]                                      (FINAL)

$ for n in '' 0 00 000 0000 00000 000000 0000000 00000000 000000000; do echo $n | jrte Fibonacci; done

```

In this way the notion of an *algorithm*, whereby a branching and looping series of *instructions select data* in RAM and mutate application state, is replaced by a *pattern* that extends a description of an input source so that the *data select instructions (effectors)* that merge the input data into application state. Here *target*, *effector* and *transduction* are analogues of *machine*, *instruction*, *program*. Most complex patterns can be decomposed into subpatterns, yielding collections of small cooperating transducers that are stitched together on the jrte transduction stack in response to cues in the overall pattern. 

The range of acceptable inputs includes most context-free patterns, such as XML and JSON. To support this, each transduction process has a transduction stack, enabling transducers to call other (and themselves, recursively). The range of input ordinals can be extended with a set of signal ordinals, and an input stack enables target effectors to push out-of-band information for immediate transduction, thereby interleaving a synchronous control channel with the input stream. Also, and perhaps most importantly, Jrte target effectors (Java methods) have access to RAM. These features enable transducers in the Jrte runtime to effect transforms that are out of range of simple FSTs, as the Fibonacci example above demonstrates (the Fibonacci sequence is strictly context-sensitive).

Ginr compiles input expressions to state-minimized FSTs. The jrte compiler performs another transition-minimizing transformation on compiled automata to coalesce equivalent input symbols so that transducers have maximally compact representations for runtime use. For example, if 10 digit symbols are used equivalently in all states in an FST they can be reduced to a single symbol in the transduction transition matrix. The jrte runtime loads transducers on demand and provides a simple interface for running and controlling transduction processes.

Compared to Java regex, ginr provides a more robust regular expression compiler and the jrte runtime executes regex-equivalent text transductions with much greater throughput than the Java regex runtime. Below are the results of a benchmarking runoff between Java regex and 3 different jrte transductions (see *Time is Money. RAM is Cheap* in the Javadoc overview to see the regex and ginr expressions compiled and other benchmarking details):

Jrte is a mature WIP and interested parties are encouraged to use the discussions section here to contact [me](https://github.com/jrte) for support. The general idea is to enable Java developers to embed the jrte runtime and develop transductions for domain-specific targets. The included test transductions use the base target, which provides simple select, cut, copy, paste, clear, input/output and other basic operational effectors that are themselves sufficient for most generic text mining use cases.

To get started, build ginr and jrte and see the examples below for building a gearbox and running transducers from testing artifacts included in the repo. You may then want to prepare transducers for other test artifacts you may have available. You will need ginr v2.0.2 to build transducers to use in the jrte runtime. Ginr can be cloned or downloaded from https://github.com/ntozubod/ginr. I have included a copy of the ginr executable compiled for Linux in the jrte repo to enable Github CI builds to run transduction test cases. Also included is a whitepaper providing a detailed presentation of ginr with some examples illustrating usage of the available operators. These artifacts can be found [here](https://github.com/jrte/ribose/tree/master/etc/ginr).

To build ginr,

```
	mkdir -p ~/bin
	cd src
	make -f Makefile install
```

This will install the ginr executable in ~/bin. It can be run interactively (w/o line-edit) or from a catention of files into stdin. The lower- and uppercase letters of the 7-bit ASCII character set are preset token names assigned to the respective characters. Most common `\n\t` etc shortcuts are accepted for non-printing 7-bit control bytes. Multibyte (`...\xHH...` <- with backquotes) and 8-bit `'\xHH'` tokens can also be defined to represent non-ASCII characters present in the transduction domain. (TODO: Define example assigning UNICODE encoding to variable with UNICODE entity name for common non-ASCII characters, define variables for whole set and useful subsets for inclusion in batch compilation prologues).

Single- or multi-tape expressions are compiled on receipt of a semicolon(;). Compiled expressions can be assigned to variables and referenced in other expressions for inline inclusion.

ginr must be on your search PATH before building jrte. To build jrte and related javadoc artifacts,

```
	ant -f build.xml all-clean
```

Transducers are defined in ginr source files (`*.inr`), each directing compiled FST output to an intermediate build directory  (`:save ...` in ginr source). It is helpful to define a base set of common artifacts in a prologue. To compile the complete suite of transducers pipe the catenation of prologue with `*.inr` source files into ginr. Then run the jrte compiler as shown below to assemble FSTs into a gearbox for runtime use with its associated target.

```
	automata=build/patterns/automata
	gearbox=build/patterns/Jrte.gears
	target=com.characterforming.jrte.base.BaseTarget
	cat test-patterns/!prologue test-patterns/*.inr | ginr
	java -cp build/java/jrte-HEAD.jar com.characterforming.jrte.compile.GearboxCompiler --maxchar 128 --target $target $automata $gearbox
```

Any subclass of `BaseTarget` can serve as target class. The `--maxchar` parameter specifies the maximal input ordinal expected in input. The value 128 limits input text to 7-bit ASCII (ginr was written in 1980 on a 16-bit VAX). To transduce UNICODE text that includes 8-bit or multibyte characters from raw byte streams define a set of variables with UNICODE entity names assigned to the `\xdd...` equivalents of the corresponding binary UNICODE sequences. Then use `--maxchar=256`.

Also, while ginr recogizes identifiers enclosed in `back-quotes`, as first-order atomic entities (like 'A'), and these identifiers may include `\xdd` bytes, inclusion of `\x00` will force truncation, just so you know.

To use a `transducer` compiled into a `gearbox` to transduce an `input` file, for example (the --nil option prepends an initial `!nil` signal to the input stack before running the transduction),

```
	transducer=LinuxKernel
	input=test-patterns/inputs/kern.log
	gearbox=build/patterns/Jrte.gears
	cat $input | java -cp build/java/jrte-HEAD.jar com.characterforming.jrte.Jrte --nil $transducer $gearbox
```

To use the jrte runtime to set up and run transductions in a Java application, include jrte-HEAD.jar in classpath. Classes in `com.characterforming.jrte.compile.*` classes are never loaded by the jrte runtime. Application classes import supporting classes from runtime `com.characterforming.jrte` packages and subpackages as required. See related Javadoc and `etc/sh/*.sh` for more details and examples relating to runtime use.

To build the Javadoc materials (only) for Jrte,

```
	ant -f build.xml javadoc
