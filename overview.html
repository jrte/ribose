	<a href="https://github.com/jrte/ribose" target="_blank"><b>Ribose</b></a> is about inversion of
	control for high-volume text analysis and information extraction and transformation. For a more 
	detailed presentation see the README at <a href="https://github.com/jrte/ribose" target="_blank">https://github.com/jrte/ribose</a>.
	<br><br>
	The ribose compiler builds transducers from <b><a href="https://github.com/ntozubod/ginr" target="_blank">ginr</a></b>
	automata and packages them in persistent models for use in the ribose runtime. The ribose runtime
	is a container for any number of transduction processes, each driving an input source through an
	{@link com.characterforming.ribose.ITransductor} to an {@link com.characterforming.ribose.ITarget}
	expressing tightly-focused {@link com.characterforming.ribose.IEffector} and 
	{@link com.characterforming.ribose.IParameterizedEffector} effectors. Each transduction instance
	is itself an {@code ITarget} implementation presenting a set of built-in effectors that are 
	implicitly	available to all transducers. These core effectors are listed in the
	{@link com.characterforming.ribose.ITransductor} interface documentation.
	<br><br>
	The ribose {@link com.characterforming.ribose.IRuntime} engine loads transducers from model
	files and binds them to targets to start ribose	transductions. Each transduction is 
	encapsulated in a {@link com.characterforming.ribose.ITransductor} instance, which maintains
	a transducer stack and an input stack. Ginr transcodes Unicode characters	in ribose transducer
	patterns to UTF-8 byte sequences that may involve multiple transitions in compiled automata.
	Primary input is presented as a stream of {@code byte} and may contain UTF-8 encoded text 
	and/or binary data. The transductor presents an {@link com.characterforming.ribose.IOutput}
	view to each effector bound to the transduction target, enabling them to pull transduction
	outputs into the target domain. Data are extracted as {@code byte} sequences, and captured
	text and binary data are decoded by target effectors when they are pulled from the
	transduction process.
	<br><br>
	Ribose transductions operate in the {@code byte} <b>*</b>-semiring
	augmented	with out-of-band (&gt;255) control signals, which may be pushed onto the
	input stack	as required to effect governance for transduction processes. The built-in
	signals	<i>nul nil eol eos</i> can be augmented with additional signals and used in ribose
	transducer patterns. For example, {@code [count[`~length` `!token`]] (byte, paste count)* token}
	sets a counter using a previously captured {@code `~length`} value and ties it to a
	{@code `!token`} signal. Bytes are captured ({@code paste}) and counted ({@code count})
	until the counter pops and pushes the {@code token} signal onto the input stack for
	immediate consumption.
	<br><br>
	See the {@link com.characterforming.ribose} package for ribose interfaces	and runnable
	compiler and transduction classes {@link com.characterforming.ribose.TCompile} and 
	{@link com.characterforming.ribose.TRun}. The {@link com.characterforming.ribose.base}
	package	includes ribose base classes for extension and use in other domains. Specialized
	targets that compose domain objects from transduction outputs can be realized by 
	implementing the ITarget interface in a class with additional domain-specific effectors. See
	<i><a href="https://github.com/jrte/ribose/wiki#ginr-as-a-service-provider" target="_blank">	
	Ginr as a Service Provider</a></i> and {@link com.characterforming.ribose.TCompile} for an example
	of a specialized ITarget implementation.
