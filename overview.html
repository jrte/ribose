<a href="https://github.com/jrte/ribose" target="_blank"><b>Ribose</b></a> is about inversion of
control for high-volume text analysis and information extraction and transformation. For a more
detailed presentation see <a href="https://github.com/jrte/ribose#readme" target="_blank">
https://github.com/jrte/ribose</a>.
<br><br><b>How Do I Work This?</b><br><br>
The ribose model compiler builds transducers from <b><a href="https://github.com/ntozubod/ginr"
target="_blank">ginr</a></b> automata and packages them in persistent models for use in
the Java runtime. A copy of the ginr <a href="https://github.com/jrte/ribose/wiki/Ginr"
target="_blank">user guide</a> is published, with a sidebar index, on the ribose wiki.
<br><br>
Ginr automata for ribose are 3-tape finite state transducers (FSTs) compiled
from 3-dimensional regular patterns that express the source syntax on the input tape and
unambiguously map it onto parameterized effectors, expressed by a target, that extract and
assimilate input data into the target domain.  Ginr encodes Unicode literal characters and
tokens, eg 'Σ', 'Π', `ΣΠ`, as multibyte UTF-8 sequences and the encoded form is used
throughout ribose. This is largely transparent to end users, but care must be taken when
pasting non-ASCII text in ribose patterns. For example ('ΣΠ', paste) and ('Π', paste)
will paste only the last byte of the encoded 'Π', whereas  ('ΣΠ' @@ PasteAny) gets them
all. If not certain that all input is 7-bit ASCII it is better to use {@code PasteAny}
if the intention is to paste entire sequences of UTF-8 bytes.
<br><br>
In the Java runtime, compiled ribose models are presented through the {@code IModel} and
{@code ITransductor} interfaces. A transductor provides a Java thread with a transducer stack,
an input stack and a {@code run()} method that drives input through the transducer stack to
{@code IEffector<T extends ITarget>} effectors expressed by an {@code ITarget} instance. 
The transductor invokes the target effectors in response to syntactic cues in the input,
and the effectors act on the target to get stuff done. Transduction ends when the input or
transducer stack dries up, but the transductor persists and can be reused for subsequent
transductions.
<br><br><b><i>Ribose Transducer Patterns</i></b><br><br>
So, to begin, you will need to prepare some ribose transducer patterns, compile them to
FSTs, and save the FSTs to a directory to be compiled into a ribose model file. You will
likely want to prepare a ginr source file, or prologue, that defines <a 
href="https://github.com/jrte/ribose/blob/master/patterns/alpha.inr" target="_blank">
common character classes</a> and other patterns that are generally used throughout your
other transducer patterns. For example, the ribose prologue {@code alpha.inr} defines
{@code PasteAny=(byte,paste)*}, which is essential for transcribing multibyte UTF-8
character encodings. Prepend your prologue to your other ginr source files for ginr
compilation.
<br><br>
For example, the ribose compiler model {@code TCompile.model} includes an {@code Automaton}
transducer pattern, shown <a href="https://github.com/jrte/ribose/blob/master/patterns/ribose/Automaton.inr"
target="_blank">here</a>, that is compiled with the {@code rinr} shell script as follows:
<br><pre>./rinr patterns/alpha.inr patterns/ribose patterns/after.inr</pre>
which produces {@code build/compiler/Automaton.dfa}. The ribose model compiler then
transduces each FST (*.dfa) file in the {@code build/automata} directory to assemble
a ribose transducer and saves each transducer in {@code TCompile.model}.
<br><pre>./ribose compile build/automata build/TCompile.model</pre>
The target in this case is the {@code ModelCompiler}, which expresses three
effectors to extract {@code Header} and {@code Transition} records and finally
assemble a ribose transducer ({@code Automaton}) and persist it in {@code
TCompile.model}. A {@code build/TCompile.map} file is also produced, listing
the model target class name along with names and ordinals for the transducers,
effectors, parameters, fields and signals defined or contained in the model.
The {@code TCompile} model contains only one transducer, which can be decompiled
by the model decompiler:
<br><pre>./ribose decompile build/TCompile.model Automaton</pre>
More examples of ginr patterns for ribose transducers can be found in the {@code
patterns/test} directory, with some discussion in the <a 
href="https://github.com/jrte/ribose#more-examples" target="_blank">ribose wiki</a>.
These test patterns are compiled into {@code build/Test.model} for CI testing, with
test inputs extracted from {@code patterns/test/inputs.zip}. The test model target 
class is contained in {@code jars/ribose-0.0.2-test.jar}, which needs to be specified
(not necessary for the ModelCompiler and SimpleTarget target classes as they are
contained in the ribose jar file). To build the test model from the test patterns
you would proceed as follows:
<br><pre>-: targetpath="--target-path jars/ribose-0.0.2-test.jar"
-: ./rinr patterns/alpha.inr patterns/test patterns/after.inr
-: ./ribose compile $targetpath --target com.characterforming.jrte.test.TestTarget build/automata build/Test.model</pre>
To test the <a href="https://github.com/jrte/ribose/blob/master/patterns/test/Fibonacci.inr"
target="_blank">Fibonacci</a> transducer:
<br><pre>-: unzip -p patterns/test/inputs.zip fib.txt | ./ribose run $targetpath --nil build/Test.model Fibonacci -

<br><b><i>Transduction Targets and Effectors</i></b><br><br>
To continue with the biologic metaphor, a transduction target presents itself to
the transductor like a cell with receptors that effect specific changes inside the
cell when they recognize specific shapes on the outside. Receptors typically don't
interact with each other they just do their very specific thing, but there are
lots of different shapes floating around so it all works out for the cell. Same
with transduction targets. The transductor knows nothing about target semantics, it
just presents input to transducers that engage very specific target effectors as
they recognize specific input patterns. Stuff happens in the target, maybe. That's
all the transductor knows about the target.
<br><br>
Every ribose model is associated with a specific transduction target class that
expresses a collection of effectors. A transduction target class is any class that
has a public default constructor and implements the {@code ITarget} interface, which
exposes two methods: {@code String getName()} and {@code IEffector<?>[]
getEffectors()}. The name can be whatever you like, and the target can express
as many effectors as required. Effectors must extend {@code IEffector<T extends
ITarget>} or {@code IParameterizedEffector<T extends ITarget,P> extends IEffector<T>>}
and are usually implemented as private inner classes of the target class, which
allows them to access the private members of the target. Targets can be fat like 
{@code ModelCompiler} or they may be mere facades like {@code SimpleTarget} that
hold a secret something that only their effectors know. Whatever works best for 
your situation.
<br><br>
The transductor is itself a target expressing a suite of core effectors that are
sufficient for transducers that transform input and write raw bytes to an output
stream. For UTF-8 input these transforms are effected without decoding or encoding
of input or output. These core effectors, which are listed in the {@code 
ITransductor} documentation, are injected into every target and are available for use
in any ribose transducer. A {@code SimpleTarget} target implementation that expresses
only the {@code ITransductor} effectors is provided. Ribose models that are bound
to {@code SimpleTarget} are called <i>simple</i> models.
<br><br>
Specialized targets can define additional, domain-specific, effectors. Composite
targets, comprised of >1 {@code ITarget} instances, can be presented for transductor
binding. In that case, one target is selected to gather effectors from all participating
targets into a single array that it presents to the transductor in its {@code
getEffectors()} method. In any case, each effector receives a reference to its
respective target. Models that are associated with a specialized target as referred
to as <i>fancy</i> models.
<br><br><b><i>Building and Using Ribose Models</i></b><br><br>
The {@code Ribose} class provides a {@code main()} method that enables models to be
compiled, run and decompiled, as described in the {@code Ribose} class documentation.
It can be executed via the java command line or the provided {@code ribose} shell 
script. The runtime features are encapsulated in the {@code IModel} interface. For further
information please refer to the package and interface documentation contained herein. 
See the {@link com.characterforming.ribose} package for ribose interfaces and the runnable
{@link com.characterforming.ribose.Ribose} class. The {@link com.characterforming.ribose.base}
package includes ribose base classes for extension and use in other domains.
