Jrte is about inversion of control for high-volume text analysis and data extraction. The input 
source stream selects, via a finite-state transducer, a sequence of Java operations (effectors) 
to be performed against a bound Java object (target). It relies on ginr to produce transducers 
(gears), which it packages into a gearbox for runtime operation.
<p>
Input symbols include characters (Java char) represented as Unicode ordinal values up to a declared
maximal Unicode ordinal M and signals (Java char[N], N>1) represented as Unicode ordinal values >M. 
Signals include base control signals nul (nothing), nil (something), eol (end of line), and eos 
(end of stream), counters (end of countdown), and tags (matched character sequence in input stream).
Client applications may select the maximal Unicode character ordinal and define additional signals
as required.
<p>
Jrte includes a gearbox compiler for ginr transducers and a runtime transduction engine. Gears 
are pushed onto a runtime stack to drive information from a stack of input sources onto effector 
methods expressed by a bound target. The Jrte transduction class expresses effectors that control 
the transduction gear and input stacks, copy input symbols (characters) and set named values from 
copied input sequences, manage countdown counters, and scan input for tags. Client applications 
can define their own target classes to express additional effectors to suit application-specific 
needs. 
<p>
Typical client applications will use the built-in transduction effectors to extract named values 
from the input and define a specialized target class with additional effectors that assemble domain
objects from the extracted named values.
