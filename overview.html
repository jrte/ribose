	<a href="https://github.com/jrte/ribose" target="_blank"><b>Ribose</b></a> is about inversion of
	control for high-volume text analysis and information extraction and transformation. For a more 
	detailed presentation see the README at <a href="https://github.com/jrte/ribose" target="_blank">https://github.com/jrte/ribose</a>.
	<br><br>
	The ribose compiler builds transducers from ginr automata and packages them in persistent
	models for use in the ribose runtime. The ribose runtime is a container	for any number of
	transduction processes,	each driving an input source through an {@link com.characterforming.ribose.ITransductor}
	to an {@link com.characterforming.ribose.ITarget} expressing tightly-focused 
	{@link com.characterforming.ribose.IEffector} and {@link com.characterforming.ribose.IParameterizedEffector}
	effectors. Each transduction instance is itself an {@code ITarget} implementation presenting
	a set of built-in effectors	that are implicitly	available to all transducers. These core
	effectors are listed in the {@link com.characterforming.ribose.ITransductor} interface
	documentation.
	<br><br>
	The ribose {@link com.characterforming.ribose.IRuntime} engine loads transducers from model
	files and binds them to targets to start ribose	transductions. Each transduction is 
	encapsulated in a {@link com.characterforming.ribose.ITransductor} instance, which maintains
	a transducer stack and an input stack. The transductor presents an {@link com.characterforming.ribose.IOutput}
	view to each effector bound to the transduction target, enabling them to pull bytes extracted
	from the input into the target domain. 
	<br><br>
	See the {@link com.characterforming.ribose} package for ribose interfaces	and runnable
	compiler and transduction classes {@link com.characterforming.ribose.TCompile} and 
	{@link com.characterforming.ribose.TRun}. The {@link com.characterforming.ribose.base}
	package	includes ribose base classes for extension and use in other domains. Specialized
	targets that compose domain objects from transduction outputs can be realized by 
	implementing the ITarget interface in a class with additional domain-specific effectors. See
	<a href="https://github.com/jrte/ribose/wiki#ginr-as-a-service-provider" target="_blank">	
	Ginr as a Service Provider</a> and {@link com.characterforming.ribose.TCompile} for an example
	of a specialized ITarget implementation.
