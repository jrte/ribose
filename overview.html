<a href="https://github.com/jrte/ribose" target="_blank"><b>Ribose</b></a> is about inversion of
control for high-volume text analysis and information extraction and transformation. For a more
detailed presentation see <a href="https://github.com/jrte/ribose#readme" target="_blank">https://github.com/jrte/ribose</a>.
<br><br>
The ribose model compiler builds transducers from <b><a href="https://github.com/ntozubod/ginr" target="_blank">ginr</a></b>
automata and packages them in persistent models for use in the ribose runtime. Ginr
transcodes Unicode characters in ribose transducer patterns to UTF-8 byte sequences
that may involve multiple transitions in compiled automata, and binary {@code byte*}
sequences can be represented in ginr tokens. The ribose runtime is a container for any
number of transduction processes, each driving an input source through an
{@link com.characterforming.ribose.ITransductor} to an {@link com.characterforming.ribose.ITarget}
expressing tightly-focused {@link com.characterforming.ribose.IEffector} and
{@link com.characterforming.ribose.IParameterizedEffector} effectors. Every
{@link com.characterforming.ribose.ITransductor} instance includes itself as an
{@link com.characterforming.ribose.ITarget} presenting a set of built-in effectors
that are implicitly available in all transduction patterns. These are listed in the
{@link com.characterforming.ribose.ITransductor} interface documentation.
<br><br>
The ribose runtime component {@link com.characterforming.ribose.IRuntime} loads transducers
from model files and binds them to targets to start ribose transductions. Each transduction is
encapsulated in a {@link com.characterforming.ribose.ITransductor} instance, which maintains
a transducer stack and an input stack. Ribose transductors operate in the {@code byte}
<b>*</b>-semiring augmented with out-of-band (&gt;255) control signals, which may be pushed
onto the input stack as required to effect governance for transduction processes. The built-in
signals <i>nul nil eol eos</i> can be augmented with additional signals for use in ribose
transducer patterns. Primary input is presented to the transductor as a {@code byte*} stream
and may contain UTF-8 encoded text and/or binary data. The transductor presents an
{@link com.characterforming.ribose.IOutput} view to each effector bound to the target,
enabling effectors to pull extracted data into the target domain. Data are extracted as
{@code byte*} sequences, and decoded by target effectors when they are pulled from
the transduction output.

See the {@link com.characterforming.ribose} package for ribose interfaces and runnable
compiler and transduction classes {@link com.characterforming.ribose.TCompile} and
{@link com.characterforming.ribose.TRun}. The {@link com.characterforming.ribose.base}
package includes ribose base classes for extension and use in other domains. Specialized
targets that compose domain objects from transduction outputs can be realized by
implementing the ITarget interface in a class with additional domain-specific effectors. See
<i><a href="https://github.com/jrte/ribose/wiki#ginr-as-a-service-provider" target="_blank">
Ginr as a Service Provider</a></i> for an example of a specialized target class with domain
specific effectors.
