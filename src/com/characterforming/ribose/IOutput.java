/**
 * Provides loggers, UTF-8 codecs and a view of fields (data extracted by the transduction)
 * to {@link IEffector} implementations. Effectors receive their {@code IOutput} instance via
 * {@link IEffector#setOutput(IOutput)} when they are first bound to a transductor. Fields can be
 * accessed by name or ordinal number as {@link IField} instances. There is an anonymous field
 * with ordinal 0 that can be referenced by the anonymous name token (`~`) in patterns or by the
 * empty string in Java. Fields are referenced with a field type prefix <b>~</b> in ribose 
 * transducer patterns (eg, {@code out[`~data`]}) and without the type prefix in Java (eg,
 * {@code getFieldOrdinal("data")}.
 * <br><br>
 * All effectors receive with {@code IOutput} identical instances of loggers and codecs,
 * which are shared by the transductor and its effectors. The compiler logger is exposed
 * here for use by proxy effectors in compilation contexts and should not be
 * used otherwise. The runtime logger should be used to log events in live transduction
 * contexts.
