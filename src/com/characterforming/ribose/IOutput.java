/**
 * Provides loggers and a view of fields (data extracted by the transduction) to {@link
 * IEffector} implementations. Effectors receive their {@code IOutput} instance via
 * {@link IEffector#setOutput(IOutput)} when they are first bound to a transductor. Transducer 
 * fields are local and bound to the defining transducer and can be accessed by stable
 * field ordinal numbers. Every transducer has an anonymous field with ordinal number 0 
 * (the anonymous name token (`~`) in transducer patterns). Ordinal numbers for named
 * fields (referenced with a <b>~</b> field type prefix in patterns, eg, {@code
 * out[`~data`]}) are obtained by providing defining transducer and field names to {@link
 * #getLocalizedFieldIndex(String, String)}. Effectors should obtain field ordinals in {@code
 * setOutput()} and retain then for use with the data transfer methods {@link #asInteger(int)},
 * {@link #asReal(int)}, {@link #asBytes(int)} and {@link #asString(int)} in {@link
 * IEffector#invoke()} and {@link IParameterizedEffector#invoke(int)} as shown in the
 * example below.
