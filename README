You will need ginr v2.0.2 from googlecode to build jrte. Ginr can be downloaded from:
	http://code.google.com/p/ginr/downloads/detail?name=ginr-2.0.2.tgz&can=2&q=
After unpacking the tarball,
	mkdir -p ~/bin 
	cd ginr-2.0.2/src
	make -f Makefile install
This will install the ginr executable in ~/bin. If this directory is not on your search
PATH it must be added to the PATH before building jrte.

To build jrte, 
	cd .../jrte
	ant -f Build.xml all-clean
See .../jrte/etc/sh/*.sh for examples showing how to run simple transductions.
